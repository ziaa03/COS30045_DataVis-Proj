# COS30045_DataVis-Proj

1. A Data Visualization Process Book (submitted as a PDF) which includes:
   - Context and requirements
   - Data elements
   - Data visualization design
   - Validation (bonus)
   - Visual presentation
   - Written expression

2. A link to a live website featuring the data visualization

3. Code (included in an appendix)

The project focuses on creating a visualization using real-world data related to The OECD Environmental Statistics database which provide a unique collection of policy-relevant environmental statistics:
- You need to find at least three different visualizations.
- You should not choose visualizations that have already been discussed in blogs, textbooks, or other academic sources.

Good places to look for these visualizations include:
- Newspapers
- Information-style websites
- Scientific papers

Your task is to critique these visualizations, not to create your own. When critiquing the visualizations, you'll likely need to consider aspects such as:
- Effectiveness in communicating the data
- Design choices
- Clarity and ease of understanding
- Appropriateness for the target audience
- Use of color, layout, and other visual elements
- Any interactive features (if present)
- Accuracy and completeness of the data representation

The Process Book should include:
- Title page
- Table of contents
- Introduction (background, motivation, project objectives)
- Data section (source, processing, characteristics)
- Requirements (must-have and optional features)
- Visualization design (showing the design process, sketches, iterations)
- Website implementation
- Reflection on the project

The project is weighted at 70% of the course grade and includes:
- Standup presentation (5%)
- Design Process Book (30%)
- Website (20%)
- Reflection (15%)
